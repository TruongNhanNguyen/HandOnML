# Overview

> The repository contains notebooks of examples and code solutions (some notebooks have excercise answers) for all chapters of the book __Hands On Machine Learning with ScikitLearn Keras and Tensorflow__

This project aims at studying the fundamentals of Machine Learning in python. It contains the example code and solutions to the exercises in the second edition of the O'Reilly book ___Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow___

# Index

View the [index](index.md) to follow the structure of the books and have a concise view of the learning path of Machine Learning.

# Quick Start

## Want to play with these notebooks online without having to install anything?

Use any of the following services (I recommended Colab or Kaggle, since they offer free GPUs and TPUs).

> **WARNING**: _Please be aware that these services provide temporary environments: anything you do will be deleted after a while, so make sure you download any data you care about._
